# Time Series Prediction of Alcohol-Related Traffic Accidents in Munich, Germany

## Project Overview
The city of Munich has released a dataset detailing the monthly traffic accidents categorized by type, starting from the year 2000. This project focuses on analyzing two specific categories: 'Alkoholunfälle' (alcohol-related accidents) and 'Fluchtunfälle' (hit-and-run accidents), as well as the overall volume of traffic incidents. The primary objective is to construct a regression model capable of forecasting future alcohol-related accidents.

## Historical Visualization and Analysis
An initial step in the project was to historically visualize the frequency of accidents and to examine correlations between the different categories. 

## Model Development
Two simple models were developed, with the year, month, and quarter as input features. Given the number of data points and the simplicity of the features, the models struggled to accurately capture the underlying patterns and predict future incidents effectively. Machine learning is an iterative process that requires repeated experimentation with various methods to optimize results.
There are still many ways how the outcomes could be improved, here some to name a few:

- **Additional Features:** Introducing more variables may improve performance. This could include using other categories of traffic accidents.
  
- **Experimenting with Different Models:** Neural networks, may be able to detect more complex patterns within the data. 

- **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA:** ARIMA models are popular for their effectiveness in time series forecasting. Given additional time, exploring ARIMA would be a logical progression for this project. 

As machine learning is an interative proceess of continous learning, this project represents a snapshot of an ongoing journey rather than a final destination.
